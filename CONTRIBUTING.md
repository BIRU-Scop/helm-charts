# How to contribute

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Tenzu.

As this project is in its early stage, we are not yet able to accept most forms of contribution,
be it features, documentation or bug reports. As such, we will not accept issues or pull 
requests through Github yet.

We are still fixing bugs and changing a lot of things every day so adding contribution
while the project is still this unstable would be too difficult.

We hope to have a more mature codebase to give you soon so we can fully embrace the 
collaboration spirit of opensource.

In the meantime, we would love to hear from you at our [community website](https://community.tenzu.net).
Whether it be about ideas that you have, how you have been using Tenzu or about your interest in
contributing in the future. We are very active there and you'll be able to receive news about our 
progress!

it is one by first removing any mention of our trademarks (Tenzu name and logo) from it.
